Amtrak Lateness Predictor
===

The tool Amtrak doesn't want you to have â€¦ or at least doesn't publish themselves.

Use historical arrival data to predict what time you will arrive at your destination. Past routes will be averaged to estimate your delay into a given station, controlling for the timeliness of the train you're currently riding, and other factors.

Amtrak Lateness Predictor
===

The tool Amtrak doesn't want you to have â€¦ or at least doesn't publish themselves.

Use historical on-time performance data to predict what time you will arrive at your destination. Controlling for the day of the week and the timeliness of your current train so far, similar past routes will be averaged to estimate your delay into a given station.
